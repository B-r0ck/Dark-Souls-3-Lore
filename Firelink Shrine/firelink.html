            Firelink Shrine is the first location in any dark souls game that acts 
            as a safe haven for your character and other NPC’s (Non-Player Characters). 
            In every game, the Firelink Shrine location will protect you from outside threats, 
            and hold characters that allow you to adequately progress through the game. 
            <br>
            <br>
            While this location in the game holds physical value, it also offers a lot “lore wise”. 
            The name “Firelink Shrine” suggests that this particular place is where the Fire is (to be) linked. 
            A very important detail in this room are the thrones made of what appears to be stones. 
            There is one throne, for every soul of cinder. When every soul of cinder is returned to their throne, 
            the fire will once again be linked, hopefully re-kindling the fire.

        <p id="firekeepertitle">The Fire Keeper</p>
        <p class="firekeeperpg">
            Every enemy you kill in this game including bosses, will give you a certain amount of ‘souls’. 
            The more powerful the enemy, the more souls they give. Just think if the ‘souls’ as a currency in the game. 
            This particular NPC called “The Firekeeper”, will level your character in exchange for souls.
             Leveling your character is a very essential part of this game. Only few are skillful enough to complete 
             the game without leveling their character.

        <p class="handmaidpg">
            This NPC is where you should really consider your souls to be currency. 
            She will offer many goods and items in exchange for souls. The items she will sell are 
            very helpful if not essential to the journey of the player. 
            Lore-wise, this character is not offered much.

        <p class="andrepg">
            Blacksmith Andre is a blacksmith that is found in all 3 games of dark souls. 
            He is responsible for upgrading your weapons and your “Estus Flasks” which are the main 
            healing item in the game. He will make your Estus Flasks more powerful, 
            granted that you bring him the right item to upgrade it. 
            The game will be absolutely impossible without the use of this NPC’s services.
