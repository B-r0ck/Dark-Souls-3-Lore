                The Cathedral of the Deep, is home to a large number of enemies including: 
                Reanimated Corpses, Evangelists, Giants, and the Deacons of the Deep. 
                Most of these enemies are there  to get in the way and prove to be exceptionally irritating. 
                The more notable enemy of them all are The Deacons of the Deep, the gatekeepers to Aldrichâ€™s tomb. 
                The cathedral is where Aldrich was initially buried after linking the flame. 
                Once he was revived to try and re-link the flame, he fled the Cathedral and took refuge in Anor Londo, 
                which is the highest tower in Irithyll. The Deacons still remained, 
                almost as if they were waiting for Aldrich to return. The duty of the Deacons before they became hollow, 
                was to serve Aldrich in the way of providing him with people to eat, assistants with research in magic.
                 In order to progress through the game and eliminate the remaining Lords of Cinder, 
                 you are required to slay the Deacons of the Deep.
